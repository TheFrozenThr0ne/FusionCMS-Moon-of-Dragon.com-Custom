/**
 * Note to module developers:
 * Keeping a module-specific language file like this
 * in this external folder is not a good practice for
 * portability - I do not advise you to do this for
 * your own modules since they are non-default.
 * Instead, simply put your language files in
 * application/modules/yourModule/language/
 * You do not need to change any code; the system
 * will automatically look in that folder too.
